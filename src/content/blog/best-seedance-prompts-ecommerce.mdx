AI-generated product videos are changing e-commerce. Instead of hiring a production crew for every SKU, you can generate professional-looking video content with a well-crafted Seedance prompt. The trick is knowing how to write prompts that produce consistent, on-brand results.

Here are 10 battle-tested prompt templates organized by use case. Each one is ready to customize with your product details.

## Product Showcase Prompts

### 1. The 360-Degree Hero Shot

```
A [product] slowly rotating on a clean white pedestal, soft studio
lighting from above, gentle shadows beneath, seamless white background,
the camera orbits smoothly around the product at eye level,
photorealistic product photography style, 4K commercial quality
```

**Best for**: Hero images on product pages, Amazon listings, Shopify stores.

**Tips**: Replace `[product]` with a detailed description including color, material, and size. The more specific you are about the product, the more accurate the output. Add "matte finish" or "glossy surface" to control material rendering.

### 2. The Feature Close-Up

```
Extreme close-up macro shot of a [product], camera slowly pulling
back to reveal the full product, dramatic side lighting highlighting
texture and craftsmanship, shallow depth of field with creamy bokeh
background, luxury product commercial aesthetic
```

**Best for**: Premium products where texture and build quality matter — watches, leather goods, electronics, jewelry.

### 3. The Color Variant Showcase

```
A [product] centered on a minimalist surface, studio lighting,
the product smoothly transitions through color variants — first
[color 1], then [color 2], then [color 3] — with a subtle morphing
effect, clean commercial style, neutral background
```

**Best for**: Showing multiple colorways in a single video. Works well for phone cases, apparel, accessories.

## Unboxing Prompts

### 4. The Premium Unboxing

```
Hands carefully opening a sleek [brand-style] packaging box,
revealing a [product] nestled in premium packaging material,
top-down camera angle, soft natural lighting from a nearby window,
ASMR-style slow movements, the product catches the light as it's
lifted from the box, warm cozy atmosphere
```

**Best for**: Subscription boxes, premium electronics, gift items. The top-down angle mimics popular unboxing content on social media.

### 5. The Quick Reveal

```
A sealed [color] product box on a wooden table, a hand enters
frame and lifts the lid in one smooth motion, revealing a [product]
inside, the camera pushes in slightly for emphasis, bright and
airy lighting, clean modern interior background, satisfying reveal
moment
```

**Best for**: Short-form content for Instagram Reels or TikTok. The quick pacing matches platform expectations.

## Lifestyle Prompts

### 6. The In-Context Shot

```
A person [using/wearing/holding] a [product] in a [setting],
natural golden hour lighting, candid documentary style, shallow
depth of field keeping the product sharp, the person looks relaxed
and natural, warm color grading, lifestyle photography aesthetic
```

**Best for**: Showing products in real-world use. Replace `[setting]` with specific environments — "modern kitchen," "hiking trail," "cozy home office." Context sells.

**Tips**: Be specific about the person's action. "Pouring coffee from a [ceramic mug]" works better than "holding a mug."

### 7. The Before-and-After

```
Split-screen style video: left side shows [problem scenario] in
desaturated muted tones, right side shows [solution with product]
in vibrant warm colors, both sides animate simultaneously, clean
modern typography style, the product appears prominently on the
solution side
```

**Best for**: Cleaning products, skincare, organization tools — anything that solves a visible problem.

## Social Media Ad Prompts

### 8. The Scroll-Stopper

```
Dynamic overhead shot of a [product] dropping onto a [surface]
in slow motion, creating a satisfying visual impact, particles
or [relevant material] scatter outward, dramatic lighting with
a single spotlight, dark moody background, high contrast,
cinematic slow motion commercial
```

**Best for**: The first frame needs to stop the scroll. This template creates high-impact opening shots for paid social ads. Works especially well for cosmetics, food products, and tech accessories.

### 9. The Lifestyle Montage

```
Quick-cut montage of a [product] in three scenes: first on a
[surface A] with morning light, then being [used/worn] outdoors
in bright daylight, finally placed on a [surface B] with warm
evening lighting, each scene lasts 2 seconds, smooth transitions,
aspirational lifestyle commercial feel
```

**Best for**: Instagram and Facebook ads where you need to show versatility in a short timeframe. The three-scene structure fits naturally into 5-6 second ad formats.

### 10. The Minimal Product Drop

```
A [product] falls gracefully into frame against a solid [brand color]
background, lands softly with a subtle bounce, camera holds steady,
clean sans-serif product name "[Name]" fades in below, minimalist
Apple-style product commercial, smooth and elegant motion
```

**Best for**: Brand-forward content where simplicity is the message. Great for product launches and announcement posts.

## Prompt Writing Tips for E-commerce

Getting consistent results from Seedance requires attention to a few key principles.

**Be specific about lighting.** "Studio lighting" and "natural window light" produce very different moods. Specify the direction too — "soft lighting from the upper left" gives you more control.

**Describe the camera movement.** Seedance handles camera direction well. Use terms like "slow orbit," "push in," "pull back," "top-down," and "tracking shot" to control how the viewer experiences the product.

**Set the mood with color language.** Words like "warm," "cool," "muted," "vibrant," and "high contrast" influence the overall color grading of the output.

**Keep it under 150 words.** Seedance performs best with focused, clear prompts. If your prompt is getting long, cut the least important details first.

**Iterate and refine.** Your first generation is a starting point. Adjust lighting, camera angle, or product description based on what you see. Use our [prompt builder tool](/tools/prompt-builder) to experiment faster.
