If you're building an application that needs AI-generated video — whether it's a content platform, marketing tool, or creative app — Seedance offers some of the best quality-to-cost ratio available through API. This tutorial walks you through integrating Seedance using both **fal.ai** and **Replicate**, the two main API providers.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, you'll need:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- An API key from [fal.ai](https://fal.ai) or [Replicate](https://replicate.com)
- Basic familiarity with async Python (helpful but not required)

## Available Models via API

As of February 2026, the following Seedance models are available through third-party APIs:

| Model | Provider | Type | Resolution |
|-------|----------|------|------------|
| Seedance 1.0 Pro | fal.ai | Text-to-Video | 480p |
| Seedance 1.0 Pro | Replicate | Image-to-Video | 480p |
| Seedance 1.5 Pro | fal.ai | Text-to-Video | 720p |
| Seedance 1.5 Pro | fal.ai | Image-to-Video | 720p |

**Note**: Seedance 2.0 is not yet available via API. For 2.0 access, use Jimeng or Dreamina directly. Check our [versions page](/versions) for the latest availability.

## Method 1: fal.ai Integration

fal.ai offers the broadest selection of Seedance models with both synchronous and asynchronous execution.

### Installation

```python
pip install fal-client
```

### Set Your API Key

```python
import os
os.environ["FAL_KEY"] = "your-fal-api-key"
```

Or export it in your shell:

```bash
export FAL_KEY="your-fal-api-key"
```

### Text-to-Video (Synchronous)

The simplest approach — submit a prompt and wait for the result.

```python
import fal_client

def generate_video(prompt, duration=5):
    """Generate a video from a text prompt using Seedance 1.5 Pro."""
    result = fal_client.subscribe(
        "fal-ai/seedance-v1.5-pro",
        arguments={
            "prompt": prompt,
            "duration": duration,
            "seed": 42,  # Optional: set for reproducible results
        },
    )
    return result["video"]["url"]

video_url = generate_video(
    "A ceramic coffee mug on a wooden table, steam rising gently, "
    "morning sunlight streaming through a window, warm cozy atmosphere"
)
print(f"Video ready: {video_url}")
```

### Image-to-Video

Turn a static product image into a dynamic video clip.

```python
import fal_client

def image_to_video(image_url, prompt, duration=5):
    """Animate a static image using Seedance 1.5 Pro."""
    result = fal_client.subscribe(
        "fal-ai/seedance-v1.5-pro/image-to-video",
        arguments={
            "prompt": prompt,
            "image_url": image_url,
            "duration": duration,
        },
    )
    return result["video"]["url"]

video_url = image_to_video(
    image_url="https://example.com/product-photo.jpg",
    prompt="The product slowly rotates, soft studio lighting, "
           "clean white background, commercial photography style",
)
print(f"Video ready: {video_url}")
```

### Async with Webhooks (Production Use)

For production applications, you don't want to hold a connection open while the video generates. Use the queue-based approach with webhooks instead.

```python
import fal_client

def submit_video_job(prompt, webhook_url):
    """Submit a video generation job and receive results via webhook."""
    handler = fal_client.submit(
        "fal-ai/seedance-v1.5-pro",
        arguments={
            "prompt": prompt,
            "duration": 5,
        },
        webhook_url=webhook_url,
    )
    return handler.request_id

# Submit the job
request_id = submit_video_job(
    prompt="A sneaker floating and rotating against a gradient background",
    webhook_url="https://your-app.com/api/webhooks/fal",
)
print(f"Job submitted: {request_id}")

# Check status without blocking
status = fal_client.status("fal-ai/seedance-v1.5-pro", request_id)
print(f"Status: {status}")
```

Your webhook endpoint will receive a POST request with the completed video URL when generation finishes.

## Method 2: Replicate Integration

Replicate offers a clean API with built-in webhook support and a generous free tier for testing.

### Installation

```python
pip install replicate
```

### Set Your API Token

```python
import os
os.environ["REPLICATE_API_TOKEN"] = "your-replicate-token"
```

### Text-to-Video

```python
import replicate

def generate_video(prompt):
    """Generate a video using Seedance on Replicate."""
    output = replicate.run(
        "bytedance/seedance-v1-pro-t2v-480p",
        input={
            "prompt": prompt,
            "num_frames": 120,  # ~5 seconds at 24fps
        },
    )
    return output

video_url = generate_video(
    "A luxury watch on a dark marble surface, dramatic side lighting, "
    "the second hand ticks smoothly, cinematic product commercial"
)
print(f"Video ready: {video_url}")
```

### Image-to-Video

```python
import replicate

def image_to_video(image_path, prompt):
    """Animate an image using Seedance on Replicate."""
    output = replicate.run(
        "bytedance/seedance-v1-pro-i2v-480p",
        input={
            "prompt": prompt,
            "image": open(image_path, "rb"),
        },
    )
    return output

video_url = image_to_video(
    image_path="./product-hero.jpg",
    prompt="Gentle camera push-in, the product catches the light, "
           "subtle ambient movement in the background",
)
print(f"Video ready: {video_url}")
```

### Async with Predictions API

For production workloads, use Replicate's predictions API to avoid blocking.

```python
import replicate

def submit_async_job(prompt, webhook_url):
    """Submit an async video generation job on Replicate."""
    model = replicate.models.get("bytedance/seedance-v1-pro-t2v-480p")
    version = model.latest_version

    prediction = replicate.predictions.create(
        version=version,
        input={
            "prompt": prompt,
            "num_frames": 120,
        },
        webhook=webhook_url,
        webhook_events_filter=["completed"],
    )
    return prediction.id

prediction_id = submit_async_job(
    prompt="A pair of running shoes on a track, dynamic angle",
    webhook_url="https://your-app.com/api/webhooks/replicate",
)
print(f"Prediction submitted: {prediction_id}")
```

## Error Handling and Best Practices

Wrap your API calls with proper error handling for production use.

```python
import fal_client
import time

def generate_with_retry(prompt, max_retries=3):
    """Generate a video with retry logic and error handling."""
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            result = fal_client.subscribe(
                "fal-ai/seedance-v1.5-pro",
                arguments={
                    "prompt": prompt,
                    "duration": 5,
                },
                with_logs=True,
            )
            return result["video"]["url"]

        except fal_client.FalServerError as e:
            if "rate_limit" in str(e).lower():
                wait_time = 2 ** attempt * 10
                print(f"Rate limited. Waiting {wait_time}s...")
                time.sleep(wait_time)
            else:
                raise

    raise Exception("Max retries exceeded")
```

### Key tips for production:

- **Set a seed** for reproducible results during testing. Remove it in production for variety.
- **Use webhooks** instead of synchronous calls. Video generation takes 30-120 seconds depending on the model and duration.
- **Cache results** by prompt hash. If the same prompt is submitted twice, return the cached video instead of regenerating.
- **Implement rate limiting** on your end. Both fal.ai and Replicate have rate limits that vary by plan.
- **Store videos** in your own storage (S3, GCS, etc.) after generation. API provider URLs may expire.

## Cost Estimation

Understanding costs helps you budget for production usage.

| Provider | Model | Approximate Cost |
|----------|-------|-----------------|
| fal.ai | Seedance 1.5 Pro (5s) | ~$0.08-0.12 per video |
| fal.ai | Seedance 1.5 Pro (10s) | ~$0.15-0.20 per video |
| Replicate | Seedance 1.0 Pro (5s) | ~$0.10-0.15 per video |

Costs vary based on resolution, duration, and current provider pricing. Check each provider's pricing page for the latest rates, and see our [pricing overview](/pricing) for a comparison across all access methods.

## Next Steps

- Explore our [API reference page](/api) for endpoint details and parameter documentation
- Compare all [Seedance versions](/versions) to choose the right model for your use case
- Check [pricing](/pricing) across all platforms and API providers

The API ecosystem for Seedance is still maturing. As Seedance 2.0 becomes available through fal.ai and Replicate, expect higher resolution output and audio generation capabilities to become programmable as well.
