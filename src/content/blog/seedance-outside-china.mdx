Seedance 2.0 is one of the most impressive AI video generators available today, but there's a catch: the best platform to use it (Jimeng) requires a Chinese phone number. If you're outside China, that can feel like a dealbreaker.

It's not. Here are three methods that work in 2026.

## Method 1: Dreamina (Easiest)

**Dreamina** is ByteDance's international platform — think of it as the global version of Jimeng. It supports Seedance 1.5 Pro and 2.0.

### How to sign up:

1. Go to [dreamina.com](https://dreamina.com)
2. Click "Sign Up" and use your email or Google account
3. Verify your email
4. Navigate to the video generation section
5. Select Seedance 2.0 as your model
6. Start with your free credits

**Pros**: No Chinese phone number needed, simple signup, access to Seedance 2.0.

**Cons**: Fewer free credits than Jimeng, paid plans start at $18/month.

This is the recommended method for most international users.

## Method 2: Virtual Phone Number (Full Access)

If you want the full Jimeng experience with maximum free credits, you can use a virtual Chinese phone number service.

### Recommended services:

- **SMS-Activate** — Most reliable, ~$0.50-1.00 per number
- **5SIM** — Good alternative, similar pricing
- **MobileSMS.io** — Budget option

### Steps:

1. Create an account on SMS-Activate (or your preferred service)
2. Add funds ($2-5 is enough)
3. Search for a Chinese (+86) number for "Jimeng" or "ByteDance"
4. Go to [jimeng.jianying.com](https://jimeng.jianying.com)
5. Click sign up and enter the virtual number
6. Request the verification code
7. Check the virtual number service for the SMS code
8. Enter the code and complete registration

### Tips for success:

- If a number gets rejected, try another one — some numbers are recycled
- Complete the registration quickly (codes expire in 5 minutes)
- Don't use a VPN during registration if possible
- Save your login credentials — you won't need the phone number again for daily use

## Method 3: API Access (For Developers)

If you're comfortable with code, API platforms give you direct access to Seedance models without any phone verification.

### fal.ai

```bash
# Install the client
pip install fal-client

# Set your API key
export FAL_KEY="your-api-key"
```

```python
import fal_client

result = fal_client.subscribe(
    "fal-ai/seedance-v1-pro",
    arguments={
        "prompt": "A golden retriever running through a field of sunflowers",
        "duration": 5
    }
)
print(result["video"]["url"])
```

### Replicate

```bash
# Install the client
pip install replicate

# Set your API token
export REPLICATE_API_TOKEN="your-token"
```

```python
import replicate

output = replicate.run(
    "bytedance/seedance-v1-pro-i2v-480p",
    input={
        "prompt": "A golden retriever running through a field of sunflowers"
    }
)
print(output)
```

**Note**: As of February 2026, Seedance 2.0 is not yet available via third-party APIs. fal.ai and Replicate offer Seedance 1.0 and 1.5 variants. For 2.0, use Method 1 or 2.

## Which Method Should You Choose?

| Method | Best For | Seedance 2.0 | Difficulty |
|--------|----------|:------------:|:----------:|
| Dreamina | Most users | Yes | Easy |
| Virtual Number | Power users wanting max free credits | Yes | Medium |
| API (fal.ai/Replicate) | Developers | No (1.0/1.5 only) | Technical |

For most people, **Dreamina is the way to go**. It's the simplest path to Seedance 2.0 with no workarounds needed.

If you want the full Chinese platform experience with more free credits, the virtual phone number method works reliably — just budget $1-2 for the number.

For developers building applications, the API route through fal.ai or Replicate is the most flexible, though you'll be limited to Seedance 1.0 and 1.5 until 2.0 becomes available via API.
