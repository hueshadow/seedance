# How to Use Seedance: The Complete Guide (2026)

ByteDance's Seedance has taken the AI video generation world by storm. Whether you're a content creator, developer, or just curious about the tool that's outpacing Sora 2 and Veo 3, this guide covers everything you need to know — from getting started for free to integrating the API into your workflow.

## What Is Seedance?

Seedance is an AI video generation model developed by ByteDance's Seed team. It generates high-quality video clips from text prompts, images, videos, and audio inputs. The model is known for exceptional character consistency, realistic physics, and native audio synchronization.

## How to Register Without a Chinese Phone Number

This is the #1 barrier for international users trying to access Seedance 2.0 on Jimeng, Doubao, or Xiaoyunque. Here are your options:

### Option A: Use a Virtual Chinese Phone Number (Recommended for Quick Access)

Several services provide temporary or virtual Chinese phone numbers for SMS verification:

1. **SMS-Activate** (sms-activate.guru)
   - One-time Chinese number for ~$0.50–$2.00
   - Select "China" → search for "ByteDance" or "Douyin" as the service
   - Receive the verification code and complete registration
   - Number is disposable — save your account credentials

2. **5SIM** (5sim.net)
   - Similar service, Chinese numbers available
   - Pay-per-SMS model

3. **MobileSMS.io**
   - Offers Chinese numbers specifically for app verification

**Step-by-step process:**
1. Go to the virtual number service and purchase a Chinese number
2. Open the Jimeng/Doubao registration page
3. Enter the virtual Chinese number
4. Request the SMS verification code
5. Check the virtual number service for the incoming code
6. Enter the code to complete registration
7. Immediately bind an email address as backup login method

> ⚠️ **Important**: Virtual numbers may not always work if the platform detects them. If one number fails, try another. Prices are low enough that a few attempts are still cost-effective.

### Option B: Use International Platforms Instead

If you don't want to deal with Chinese phone numbers at all:

- **Dreamina International** (dreamina.com) — Sign up with Google/email, access Seedance 1.0/1.5
- **Third-party wrappers** like Pollo AI, Weshop AI — Access Seedance 2.0 through their interfaces
- **API platforms** like fal.ai, Replicate — Developer-friendly, no Chinese account needed

### Option C: Buy a Pre-Registered Account

Some sellers on platforms like Taobao or through social media offer pre-registered Jimeng accounts with credits. Prices range from $5–$20.

> ⚠️ **Risk warning**: Account sharing violates most platforms' ToS. Your account could be banned. Use at your own risk.

## Seedance Prompt Guide: Tips & Techniques

### Basic Prompt Structure

For Seedance 2.0, prompts work best when they're specific and cinematic:

```
[Subject] + [Action] + [Setting] + [Camera Movement] + [Mood/Lighting]
```

**Example:**
```
A young woman in a red dress walks through a rain-soaked Tokyo street at night.
Neon signs reflect off wet pavement. Camera slowly tracks behind her.
Warm orange and cool blue lighting contrast.
```

### Using the @Reference System (Seedance 2.0)

The @mention system is what makes Seedance 2.0 stand out. Upload reference files and tell the AI exactly how to use them:

**Character Reference:**
```
@Image1 is the main character. She walks into a coffee shop and sits down.
Close-up of her face as she smiles.
```

**Motion Reference:**
```
@Image1 as the character, perform the dance moves from @Video1.
Outdoor park setting, golden hour lighting.
```

**Multi-Shot Storytelling:**
```
Shot 1: Wide establishing shot of a mountain landscape at sunrise.
Shot 2: Medium shot of @Image1 standing at the cliff edge, wind blowing through hair.
Shot 3: Close-up of hands gripping a hiking pole.
```

**Video Extension:**
```
Extend @Video1 by 5s. The character continues walking and turns to look at the camera.
```

**Combining Video + Audio:**
```
@Image1 as cover, refer to @Video1's camera movement.
Background music follows the rhythm of @Audio1.
```

### Pro Tips for Better Results

1. **Be cinematic, not technical** — Describe scenes like a film director, not a programmer
2. **Specify camera movements** — "dolly in", "tracking shot", "slow pan left", "aerial view"
3. **Include lighting details** — "golden hour", "harsh overhead fluorescent", "candlelit"
4. **Use high-quality references** — 2K or 4K source images produce better results
5. **Start with 5-second clips** — Faster generation, iterate quickly before committing to longer durations
6. **Adjust Creativity vs Consistency sliders** — Start with 60% creativity / 40% consistency for balanced results
7. **One concept per generation** — Don't overload a single prompt with too many ideas
8. **Iterate incrementally** — Make small changes between generations rather than rewriting entire prompts

### Prompt Examples by Use Case

**E-commerce Product Video:**
```
A sleek wireless headphone sits on a marble surface. Camera slowly orbits 360 degrees.
Soft studio lighting with subtle reflections. Minimalist white background.
```

**Music Video / Visualizer:**
```
Abstract fluid shapes morph and pulse to the beat of @Audio1.
Vibrant neon colors against black background. Camera zooms in and out rhythmically.
```

**Short Film / Drama:**
```
@Image1 is a detective in a noir setting. He pushes open a heavy wooden door
and steps into a dimly lit bar. Smoke curls through the air.
Shot 1: Door opening from inside the bar. Shot 2: Close-up of his face, shadows across his eyes.
```

**Social Media Content (9:16):**
```
@Image1 looks directly at camera and speaks enthusiastically.
Bright, well-lit room with blurred background. Slight camera zoom in.
Natural, authentic vibe.
```
